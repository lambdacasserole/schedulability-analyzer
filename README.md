# Schedulability Analyzer
Deadline monotonic schedulability analyzer in CoffeeScript.

I wrote this for a class assignment in order to calculate whether or not a set of tasks is schedulable using the deadline-monotonic schedulability algorithm proposed by N. C. Audsley, A. Burns, M. F. Richardson and A. J. Wellings in their paper [Hard Real-Time Scheduling: The Deadline Monotonic Approach](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ssaewong/research/audsley_DMS.pdf). The source code is up here for anyone curious about how to forumlae in the paper translate into code as well as for anyone interested in the usefulness of CoffeeScript for slamming together quick scripts.

## Notes
This isn't a tool to use all sneaky-beaky like to avoid actually crunching some numbers for your homework assignment on schedulability analysis. Don't do that to yourselves and take half an hour to wrap your head around it, it's well worth it.
